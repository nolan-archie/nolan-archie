## Hi there 👋

👋 Hey there, I’m Nolan  

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m a 17-year-old developer who likes building, breaking, and fixing things — mostly in that order.

### 🧠 About Me
- 💻 I create **software** and **automation bots** for all kinds of tasks.  
- 📱 I spend way too much time porting ROMs, overclocking, and customizing Android.  
- 🧩 Languages: `C++` • `Python`  
- ⚡*Chopped Twin* ✌️  
- 🎮 I play **Genshin Impact** (probably too much).  
- 🌿 What’s grass? Still figuring that out.  
- 🎵 Music just hits hard — it’s part of the workflow.

### 💼 Devices I Use
| Device | Use |
|--------|-----|
| 📱 **Samsung A16** | ROM testing, mods, and chaos |
| 💻 **HP EliteBook 840 G5** | Main dev machine |

---

### 🔧 What I Work On
- 🤖 Automation bots  
- 🧠 AI experiments  
- ⚙️ System utilities and tools  
- 🧩 ROM and kernel mods  

---

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Improving my open project **Mem** — a framework for AI companions with memory and emotion  
- Learning advanced Python automation and backend design  
- Making efficient systems that can adapt and self-manage  

---

### 🧩 Other Stuff
- I like minimal, fast setups — if it’s slow, I’ll fix it.  
- I code at weird hours, usually with headphones on.  
- I experiment more than I plan — but it always ends up working somehow.
